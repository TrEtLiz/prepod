# Copilot Instructions for Educational Content Repository

This repository contains bilingual educational materials about game design and software development. The content is structured as lecture materials for academic use.

## Repository Structure

- `en/` - English-language lecture files (`lec1_en.md`, `lec2_en.md`, etc.)
- `ru/` - Russian-language lecture files (`lec1.md`, `lec2.md`, etc.)

## Content Patterns and Conventions

### File Naming
- English files: `lec{N}_en.md` (e.g., `lec1_en.md`)
- Russian files: `lec{N}.md` (e.g., `lec1.md`)
- Maintain parallel numbering between languages

### Markdown Structure
- Use `# Title` for main lecture topic
- Use `## Section Title` for major sections
- Use `### Subsection` for detailed breakdowns
- Use `**bold**` for key terms and concepts
- Use numbered and bulleted lists for structured content

### Callout Boxes
This repository uses GitHub-flavored markdown callouts extensively:
- `> [!Note]` - For general information and definitions
- `> [!Tip]` - For practical advice and best practices  
- `> [!Important]` - For critical concepts that need emphasis
- Note: Some files use `[!NOTE]` (all caps) - maintain existing case

### Content Guidelines
- Maintain conceptual parity between English and Russian versions
- Include practical examples from game industry (e.g., "Flappy Bird")
- Structure content with clear "Why it matters" explanations
- Use age-appropriate language for educational context
- Include psychological and business perspectives alongside technical content

### Translation Considerations
- Game design terminology: "Game Designer" vs "Геймдизайнер"
- Technical terms often kept in English in Russian text
- Maintain formatting consistency across language versions
- Preserve callout box types and styling between translations

## When Making Changes
- Update both language versions for content changes
- Preserve educational structure and flow
- Maintain academic tone while keeping content engaging
- Include relevant industry examples and case studies
- Ensure callout boxes enhance rather than interrupt reading flow
